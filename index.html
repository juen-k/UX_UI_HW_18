            <h3 class="titleHeader">About Me</h3>
            <p>I'm Juen Koechâ€”a Kenyan girl living in Minnesota!
                I've always been passionate about people and their stories and have a knack for listening and helping people find solutions to their problems.
                So much so that one word my friends use to describe me is "determined"; believing that there is a solution to every problem.
                After receiving my bachelor of science degree in psychology at Minnesota State University, Mankato, I was confident that research was the right
                direction for me. Through the University of Minnesota UX/UI Bootcamp, I came to realize just how much I love user experience research. I enjoy interviewing different users
                and understanding their needs when using a website  and finding what changes can be made to make user experiences better. Although I enjoy the design phase as well, I tend
                to gravitate towards the research portion due to the personal connections I am able to have with users.
                My personal mission statement: make the world more inclusive through technology! It can bring people together no matter their religion, disability, gender, or culture.
                My hobbies include: fighting to keep my plants alive (I'm pretty sure they're plotting against me), going on walks outside when it's nice out, foraging for medicinal
                and edible plants whenever possible, going to concerts, reading, writing, and traveling!
